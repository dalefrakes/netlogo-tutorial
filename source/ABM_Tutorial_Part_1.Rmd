# Writing Your First Models

## A Basic Template for Nearly Every Model

A newly started NetLogo model has no buttons nor any code.  But in my experience, nearly every model has a `setup` and `go` buttons.  Likewise, there are `to setup` and `to go` procedures to go with those buttons.  Most models also tend to have some `global`, `patch`, and `turtle` variables.

Instead of creating these items every time I start a model, I like to have a basic template to start from.  Such a template might look like this:

![](./img/00-base_template.png)

And the corresponding code block looks like this.
`r  filename <- '00-base_template.nlogo'`
**File: `r filename`:**
```{r comment='', echo=FALSE}
show_netlogo_file(filename)
```

Note that this NetLogo model does pretty much nothing except clear the environment.

To use this template, open it up and `save-as` using the name you want for your new model.

## A Basic Template that *Does Something*

Many models feature a population of turtles that randomly move around.  So this slightly more advanced template adds a slider to provide the count of the population, along with code in the `setup` procedure to create that population (and randomly place them in the world).  It also adds a new `wiggle` procedure that causes the turtles to randomly turn a bit, along with code in the `go` procedure to ask the turtles to `wiggle` then move forward.

Things to note:

* sliders show up as `global` variables, but they're defined in the interace and not in the code itself)
* the `wiggle` procedure was borrowed from the `Ants` model that can be found in the Model Library - the Model Library is an excellent source of ways to solve a huge variety of problems
* `wiggle` works by having the turtles turn to the right at a random angle up to 40 degrees, then to the left at another random angle up to 40 degrees.


![](./img/01-base_template_moving_population.png)

And the corresponding code block looks like this.
`r  filename <- '01-base_template_moving_population.nlogo'`
**File: `r filename`:**
```{r comment='', echo=FALSE}
show_netlogo_file(filename)
```






# A First Population Opinion Model

For our first model that exhibits some Population Opinion Dynamics, we'll start by considering some of the models described in a paper by Pawel Sobkowicz of the National Centre for Nuclear Research, Warsaw, Poland, "Extremism without extremists: Deffuant model with emotions", published in Frontiers in Physics in 2015.

## Opinions, Thresholds, and Exchanges


### Things to Consider (Leading to Variables!)

From the description of the model in the paper, we can start to think about what might be needed to implement a NetLogo model.  

First let's consider the agents:

* there's only one type of turtle (e.g. a person), so there's no need to make new `breeds`
* a person has an opinion ($person_i$ has an opinion $o_i$)

Next, let's think about global variables.  The paper mentions a threshold $d$ and an convergence rate $u$.  Since both of these can take on a range of values set by the model's user, it makes sense to make these into sliders.

It also might be helpful to define some hard limits like the bounds of opinion (-1 to 1) as global variables that are managed strictly within the code.

And while the agents wil move around and encounter one another randomly, there's no information needed about where they are, so we won't need any patch variables.

Setting up these variables, we have something that looks like this:


![](./img/03-simple-global-threshold.png)

And the corresponding code block looks like this.
`r  filename <- '03-simple-global-threshold.nlogo'`
**File: `r filename`:**
```{r comment='', echo=FALSE}
show_netlogo_file(filename)
```

Note:

* the opinions of turtles are set randomly, drawing from a uniform distribution (`random-float`)
* the shape of the turtles were changed to `people`
* we've added a turtle procedure to set their color based on the sign and intensity of their opinions

### Now the Interactions

$$ opinion_i(t + 1) = opinion_i(t) + u(opinion_j(t) - opinion_i(t)) $$
$$ opinion_j(t + 1) = opinion_j(t) + u(opinion_i(t) - opinion_j(t)) $$

And the corresponding code block looks like this.
`r  filename <- '04-simple-global-threshold.nlogo'`
**File: `r filename`:**
```{r comment='', echo=FALSE}
show_netlogo_file(filename)
```
