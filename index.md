# Intro to Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Modeling Mass Opinion Dynamics
A Netlogo Tutorial with Opinion Dynamics for the 2019 SBP-BRiMS conference


## Description: 

This tutorial session will demonstrate building some basic agent-based models (ABM) of population opinion dynamics in NetLogo. It will start by exploring various published opinion dynamics models (e.g. Zaller-Deffuant model). It will then continue with specific NetLogo topics such as implementing network models and extracting data from models for analysis.
